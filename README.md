# Multi-object Dynamic Collision Simulation & Animation in MATLAB
In this project, I have simulated collision of round bodies with each others and the walls. Coefficient of 
restitution can be modified arbitrarily for different damping scenarios. Additionally, a propeller-inspired force has also been added
to experiment with bahavior of the system in the presence of a disturbance.
